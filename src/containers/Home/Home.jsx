      A biographical film, or biopic (abbreviation for biographical motion picture), is a film that dramatizes the life of a non-fictional or historically-based person or people.
      Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.
      They differ from films "based on a true story" or "historical drama films" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.
